we used Claude and used the prompt: "you are a web developer. you are tasked with creating a simple series of web pages that will be used in an escape room. the index page is to replicate a web mail box. the mail box is completley non functional but must look like the real thing. only 12 emails in the displayed inbox can be clicked and opened. each email will need to look like a real email. the only functional items on the page are a report button and back to inbox. on clicking the report button, a popup screen will appear with a clue for the next part of the escape room. the user is tasked with only reporting those emails which look suspicious as part of a cyber threat. those emails which are not part of the cyber threat will still have a popup but the information on the popup will not be helpful in the game room. the audience for the product are professionals in the working industry. this product needs to reside on the drive of a single laptop and not to be connected to the internet. ask me any questions you need to help you complete this task. create a marking scheme for your work and only provide a response when it passes 85%. provide 3 different views of your work positive, negative and middle of the road."
